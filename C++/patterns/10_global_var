/*This listing shows how global variables work*/

#include <iostream>

int g_x; //this variable is defined outside the block, so it is global variable
const int g_y(3); //this is const variable. By default can only be used into this file

int static g_z; // this is variable that can only be used inside a single file
extern double g_a(9.8); // this is external variable that can be used in any file of program
int value(4);

int main()
{
	int value = 8; // in this case variable hide value of global variable
	value++; // only the local variable is incremeted
	::value--; // the global is decremented, because we used ::

	std::cout << value << "\n";
	std::cout << ::value << "\n";

	return 0;
} // local variable is deleted
