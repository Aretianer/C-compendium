/*How to use '?:' operator*/
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	// '?:' operator is also called the ternary operator,
	// which is used to simplify the branching 'if-else' record
	// Note, that in this case the operands must be expressions 
	
	int x = 2;
	int y = 3;
	if (x > y)
		int larger = x;
	else
		int larger = y;

	// here we use '?:'
	int a = 5;
	int b = 4;

	int larger = (a > b) ? a : b;
	std::cout << larger << std::endl;

	std::cout << ((a > b) ? a : b) << std::endl;
	return 0;
}
